			<h3>What is Blogspot?</h3>
			<article>
					<h6><em><strong>At Blogspot, our mission is to democratize publishing one website at a time.</strong></em></h6>
				<p>Blogspot is the most popular online publishing platform, currently powering more than 26% of the web. We wanted to bring the WordPress experience to an even larger audience, so in 2005 we created WordPress.com.
					We’re a hosted version of the open source software. Here, you can start a blog or build a website in seconds without any technical knowledge.</p>
